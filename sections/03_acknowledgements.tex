First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my parents for their unwavering support: Amma \& Appa, I am eternally grateful and indebted for the sacrifices you have made for me and the guidance you have blessed me with, I owe my successes to the both of you.

I'm extremely grateful to my supervisors Paul Mitchell and Andy Tyrrell, without whom this endeavour would not have been possible, for their support and guidance throughout this project. 

I could not have undertaken this journey without the support, guidance, and mentoring of Benjamin Henson, an underwater researcher at the Institute for Safe Autonomy.

I'm also grateful for my friends, providing all the entertainment and core memories that I'll cherish for my lifetime.

And the PostDocs at the Institute for Safe Autonomy, you guys are a blast to work with.
